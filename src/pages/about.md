# About me

Hi, I'm Rok Damjanić – a tech enthusiast and nature lover. I started this blog to document the projects I work on and the solutions I come across, mostly in the tech world. It’s a space where I can keep track of things I might need in the future, and hopefully, some of it will be helpful to others as well.

Alongside tech write-ups, you’ll also find posts about my experiences in nature, particularly hiking and exploring mountains. I enjoy capturing the beauty of the outdoors, and I share some of those moments here, in case you're looking for ideas on where to find a peaceful escape or explore new trails.

This blog is simply a collection of things that matter to me – both in the digital world and out in nature.
